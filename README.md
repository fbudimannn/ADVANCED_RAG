# 🩺 Advanced RAG for Medical Research

This project is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Streamlit. It is designed to answer complex medical questions related to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), stroke, and diabetes.

The application uses a sophisticated two-stage retrieval and reranking pipeline to provide accurate, evidence-based answers sourced *only* from a curated database of 9,500+ recent PubMed articles.
